Learning project for winter break is to learn basic web development fundamentals.
This includes learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and (time permitting) learning a 
framework for JS. By the end of the break, I'm aiming to have a website hosted...
somewhere with various content utilizing basic HTML/CSS and adding in some elements
to interact with via JS.
